# Sorting-visualizer-Color-codes-in-action
This project is a graphical visualization of various sorting algorithms implemented in C++. It provides an interactive environment where users can add or remove elements and see the sorting processes in action. The following sorting algorithms are implemented:
🔄 Bubble Sort
📏 Selection Sort
✏️ Insertion Sort
⚡ Quick Sort
🌀 Merge Sort

🌟 Features
Graphical Representation: Each element is represented by a filled circle, and color coding enhances visibility.
Manual Sorting Mode: Users can manually sort the array using keyboard commands, allowing for a hands-on learning experience.
Automated Sorting Mode: Choose an algorithm to visualize the sorting process, complete with stats on swaps and comparisons.
Performance Statistics: Displays detailed stats including swaps, comparisons, and time taken after sorting.

🛠️ Requirements
Graphics Library: Uses the graphics.h library. Set up your development environment to support this library.
C++ Compiler: A compatible C++ compiler (e.g., MinGW) should be installed.

📚 Instructions
Clone the repository or download the source code.
Set up your development environment with the required graphics library.
Compile and run the program.
Follow on-screen instructions to interact with the sorting algorithms.

🕹️ Usage
Use the keyboard commands as prompted in manual sorting mode.
Choose a sorting algorithm and visualize the sorting process in automated mode.
